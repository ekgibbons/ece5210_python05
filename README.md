# ECE5210 Python 05

Please answer the questions:

1.  Looking at the low-pass filter, at which frequency does the signal become attenuated?

2.  What do the results look like? Do the implementation results match?

3.  Why will the polyphase decimation get faster as M increases yet the naive decimation remains approximately the same?
